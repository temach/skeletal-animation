This program is a demo of skeletal animation in C\#. Feed it collada files with animation and bone data.

In blender spread the mesh on X-\/Y plane (so Z is normal vector) Also make it in the X$>$0, Y$>$0 quadrant. When importing a collada file remember to modify it by hand. You should change Z\+\_\+\+UP to Y\+\_\+\+UP. (I think this is only necessary while we work with Grpahics object, when we go to opengl this should fix itself)
